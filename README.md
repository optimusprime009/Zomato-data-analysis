# Zomato data analysis
 Data analysis of Zomato dataset in the city of Indore.

The commercial capital of Madhya Pradesh, Indore has another name as the “city of foodies”. This name has been given to Indore because of its Flavours, it’s variety of chats and  the wide range of street foods.

Indore city prides itself on its food. People from all across the country have settled up here, particularly from Rajasthan, Maharashtra and UP. The number of restaurants in Indore are increasing day by day. Currently around 3900 restaurants in Indore are listed on Zomato. With each day new restaurants opening the industry hasn't been saturated yet and the demand is increasing day by day !

Despite increasing demand, it however has become difficult for new restaurants to compete with established restaurants. With such an overwhelming demand of restaurants it has therefore become important to study the demography of a location.

The key issues that continue to pose a challenge to them include high real estate costs, rising food costs, shortage of quality manpower, fragmented supply chain and over-licensing. With data analytics, the project also will help people in choosing the restaurant based on several factors.

This project will help new restaurants in deciding their theme, menus, cuisine, cost, locality, etc for a particular location.

“Just so that you have a good meal the next time you step out”

The basic objective of analyzing the Zomato dataset is to gather insights about the factors affecting the establishment of different types of restaurant at different places in Indore.

This project aims at exploring demography, consumer behaviour, and food culture of the city. And what factors should be kept in mind if someone wants to open new restaurant.
